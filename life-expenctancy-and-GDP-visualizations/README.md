# Life Expectancy and GDP Project
## Project Objectives
Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to create data visualizations that communicate valuable insights from the provided data on GDP and life expectancy of six countries. The provided data will need to be preprocessed (cleaned & prepared) for effective data analysis and visualization.


### Project Scoping
* Inspect raw data (Exploratory Data Analysis)
	* Inspect columns, data types, null counts by column, print rows with nulls, etc.
	* Clean data as needed following initial inspection
* Identify potentially valuable visualizations
	* Identify possible questions that can be answered
	* Seek data that can be used to answer these questions
	* Identify appropriate charts to effectively communicate this data
* Generate visualizations
	* Apply appropriate labels, naming, coloring, etc.
* Examine chart/graph and determine if any additional filtering / cleaning / styling changes are required
	* Does each visualization have a clear purpose and do they communicate this purpose effectively?
	* Are the intended questions easily answered with the visualizations?
	* Can the visualization be simplified?
* Regenerate visualization with improvements
* Repeat final 2 steps as necessary 

Goal: generate data visualizations that communicate valuable insights into the relationship between GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

Data: data is provided by codecademy.com. For the sake of this project all needed data has been provided.

- GDP Source: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) national accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files.

- Life expectancy Data Source: [World Health Organization](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688)

Analysis: Relationships between data will be described using visualizations. 

Ethical Considerations: this data (national GDP by year) does not infringe on the privacy of any person or organization. The data is openly transparent and can be validated by anyone. The countries included in the data set are: Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, United States and Zimbabwe. These countries are relatively spread across many different categories included geographic location, culture, economy, etc, having included one country from Africa, Asia, Europe, and North, Central and South America. Limiting the dataset to only six countries restricts the datasets ability to be inclusive of all Country types, but in this case the six included are relatively spread.
